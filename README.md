## Ready! API MQTT Plugin

This plugin adds two new TestSteps to the functional testing in Ready! API - one for publishing messages to an MQTT broker and one for receiving (and asserting) messages. It integrates fully with all other Ready! API features like property expansion, property transfers, data-driven testing, etc.

Install the plugin via the Plugin Manager inside Ready! API.
